# Django blog app
### This is a simple web application that allows users to create blogs, search for them using keywords, read other blogs and share them.

## Installation
First of all, you need to have Python 3.x installed. I'm using `Python 3.11.7`.

Create a folder where your project will be located and start follow installation steps.

### 1. Creating a virtual environment and downloading github repository
Open a command line/terminal and move to the project directory, then execute these commands.

For Windows OS
```
python -m venv venv-django-blog-app
cd venv-django-blog-app
```
For Linux OS
```
python3 -m venv venv-django-blog-app
cd venv-django-blog-app
```
Then you can download this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/mananex/django-blog-app.git` in terminal/command line (**if you have git installed**), or you can just manually download the repository archive and unzip it in the virtual environment.

After cloning git repository or downloading and unzipping archive file manually, you will see a folder like `django-blog-app` or `django-blog-app-main`. You must move all files inside the folder 1 level up - **to the root directory of the virtual environment.**

After this, the virtual environment directory should look like this:

┌ venv-django-blog-app **(v-env name)**<br>
├    file1.xt<br>
├    file2.tx<br>
