# Django blog app
### This is a simple web application that allows users to create blogs, search for them using keywords, read other blogs and share them.

## Installation
First of all, you need to have Python 3.x installed. I'm using `Python 3.11.7`.

Create a folder where your project will be located and start follow installation steps.

### 1. Creating a virtual environment and downloading github repository
Open a command line/terminal and move to the project directory, then execute these commands.

For Windows OS
```
python -m venv venv-django-blog-app
cd venv-django-blog-app
```
For Linux OS
```
python3 -m venv venv-django-blog-app
cd venv-django-blog-app
```
